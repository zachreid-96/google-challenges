I was invited to the Google Foobar Challenges a couple of years ago now, but was not talented/skilled/knowledgeable enough to continue very far into the challenges. I have since grown in my skills and problem sovling.

My intent with this project is to tackle each and every Google Foobar Challenge I can find and successfully complete them given the test cases provided in the .txt files. I will also be providing my own test cases.

Shout out to [tssovi/google-foobar-challenge](https://github.com/tssovi/google-foobar-challenge) for their collection of challenges.

This will be primarily written in python3.12; however, will be using minimal external libraries in the main solution.

Please join me in my journey as I tackle these challenges. Let me know if you notice any mistakes or have any improvements!
